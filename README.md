# FacialRec

## Overview
FacialRec is a facial recognition project that utilizes AI and computer vision to detect and recognize faces in images or real-time video. The project is built using Python and OpenCV.

## Features
- Face detection using OpenCV.
- Face recognition with pre-trained models.
- Real-time video processing.
- Easy-to-use interface.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.7). You also need to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run facial recognition on an image:

```

To run real-time facial recognition using a webcam:
```bash
python recognize.py --video
```

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- dlib (if applicable)
